                                The foreign exchange market—commonly known as forex—is the world’s largest financial market, where currencies are bought and sold every second of the day. Unlike traditional stock markets, forex operates globally and remains open 24 hours, five days a week. This accessibility makes it appealing to new learners, but it also means understanding how the market functions is essential before taking any steps. In this guide, we break down the

                            <p>
                                Forex trading always involves two currencies paired together, such as EUR/USD or GBP/JPY. The first currency is called the base, and the second is the quote. When you trade, you are effectively buying one currency while selling the other. The price of a currency pair tells you how much of the quote currency you need to buy one unit of the base currency. Understanding how these pairs move is the first step toward analyzing
                                market behavior.
